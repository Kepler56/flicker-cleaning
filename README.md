# Cleaning the Flickr Dataset
<hr>

## General info
In this jupyter notebook, I used the "flickr.csv" available on Kaggle and defined a strategy to clean this data. "flickr.csv" is a csv file containing information about books 
from the British Library. I started by loading the dataset and did different operations to observe and understand the data that was in this file. After getting a better 
understanding with what I was working with, I move to the preprocessing stage. In this part I checked for null values, and removed the columns with a high percentage of missing 
data then I went on to clean the remaining columns individually.
